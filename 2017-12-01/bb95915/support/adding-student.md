# Adding yourselves to student section

To add yourself to student section you need to create a file with your github username `<username>.yml` in `_data/students` folder and please maintain the following format *EXACTLY* (replacing values where indicated):

```yaml
name: Your name
github: Your github username
image: your_image
twitter: Your twitter id
facebook: Your facebook id
bio: Some bio about yourself
lat: Your latitude
lng: Your longitude
```

**IMPORTANT:**

- All images must be optimized before uploaded to the repo via commit or PR. You may use any image optimizer of your choice.
- The images should be 240 x 240 pixels.
- Adding Facebook, Twitter, Github, etc. is not obliged. But if you do not want to include your social media accounts, please do not provide empty fields like `facebook:`.
- Avoid changing the whole file just to add yourself. Line endings should not change.
- Avoid using contractions such as *can't, don't,* etc. If there is no choice (e.g. your name has single quote mark) put double quotes (`"`) around that part.
- Try to use abbreviations in your name wherever possible, i.e. restrict your name in 13 letters (including spaces), otherwise your name might be truncated automatically. However, your name will be displayed completely when you hover on it on the website.
