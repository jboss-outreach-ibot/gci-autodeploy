# Maintainers

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

- Do not frustrate contributors: Find out what they need, help them help themselves.
- Guide new contributors. They usually do not comply to the rules and forcing them onto them can be frustrating.
- Be empathic: Better a bad PR with follow-up PRs than a closed PR and a rejected person.
- Merge pull-requests.
- Make sure people understand that you can not accept their GCI task.
